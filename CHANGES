Changes from Takahiro HIMURA's original code (version 0.0.1.1)

Version 0.1.0.1

  - Changes to the User record:

    - the userDescription and userLocation fields are now optional
      since they are not always provided;

    - added userFriends, userTweets, userLangCode, and userCreatedAt
      fields.

  - Changes to the Status record:

    - added statusEntities, statusRetweetCount and an experimental
      RetweetCount type;

    - the statusFavorite field of the Status record is now populated
      from the "favorited" field of the JSON rather than "favorite".

  - Changes to the RetweetedStatus record:

    - added the rsEntities field.

  - Added the Entities, HashTagEntity, UserEntity, and URLEntity
    types to record the entity information provided with each tweet.

Version 0.0.1.2

  - Restricts the authenticate package since version 0.11 has switched
    to the conduit package which conflicts with the use of enumerator.

  - Added a Setup.hs to stop sdist from complaining.
